## Introduction

This repository aims to be a home for my coding experiments, algorithm
explorations, visualization tricks, and more built up over the years. Whether
it's a tiny tool, a clever function, or a code snippet, they all have a place
here in the C Playground.

## Projects

- **CLI App Framework:** This project is a collection of C code that provides a versatile framework for constructing command-line interface applications in C. It leverages the CMake build system for seamless integration and utilizes the argparse argument parsing library for easy and efficient command-line argument handling. This framework simplifies the development process, making it easier to create robust and user-friendly command-line applications in C.
